## Darknet

The darknet is the internet's unused address space that is not expected to interact with other computers in the world. Any communication from the black space is regarded with suspicion because to its passive listening nature, which allows incoming packets but does not support outgoing packets. Because there are no legal hosts on the darknet, any traffic is considered unwanted and is typically treated as probing, backscatter, or misconfiguration. Network telescopes, sinkholes, and blackholes are other names for darknets.

Darknet traffic classification is critical for categorising real-time applications. Analysing darknet traffic aids in the early detection of malware and the detection of malicious actions after an outbreak.

## Improved Salp Swarm Algorithm for Feature Selection
Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is a recent metaheuristic inspired by the swarming behavior of salps in oceans. SSA has demonstrated its efficiency in various applications since its proposal.

Swarm-based algorithm can successfully avoid the local optimal constraints, thus achieving a smooth balance between exploration and exploitation. Salp swarm algorithm (SSA), as a swarm-based algorithm on account of the predation behavior of the salp, can solve complex daily life optimization problems in nature.

Here a github package have used for utlizing ISSA metaheuristic mehtods to find optimal feature subset.

# Model For Darknet Traffic Detection

In this hybrid RNN model CuDNNLSTM and CuDNNGRU have used instead of LSTM & GRU which provides Fast LSTM/GRU implementation backed by CuDNN.

## CuDNN

NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network (cuDNN) is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks. cuDNN is built on top of the CUDA framework which is how you use NVIDIA GPUs for general purpose computing tasks. High performance GPU acceleration is helpful for machine learning tasks because it it allows computers to speed up processes, saving you time.

## LSTM vs CuDNNLSTM

In Keras, the high-level deep learning library, there are multiple types of recurrent layers; these include LSTM (Long short term memory) and CuDNNLSTM. 
According to the Keras documentation, a CuDNNLSTM is a:

"Fast LSTM implementation backed by CuDNN. Can only be run on GPU, with the TensorFlow backend."
