# Credit Card Fraud Detection- Handling imbalanced Data
In Machine Learning and Data Science, Imbalanced Data Distribution occurs when observations in one class are considerably greater or lower than the others. Machine Learning techniques ignore class distribution to improve accuracy by lowering error. Fraud, anomaly, and facial recognition are instances of this issue. To prevent problem of information loss in most under-sampling techniques, near-neighbor methods are widely used.

Imbalanced Data Handling Techniques: There are mainly 2 mainly algorithms that are widely used for handling imbalanced class distribution.


1. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) Oversampling
It aims to balance class distribution by randomly increasing minority class examples by replicating them.

2. NearMiss Algorithm â€“ Undersampling
It aims to balance class distribution by randomly eliminating majority class examples. When instances of two different classes are very close to each other, we remove the instances of the majority class to increase the spaces between the two classes. This helps in the classification process.
